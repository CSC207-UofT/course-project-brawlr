### Principles of Universal Design
#### Equitable Use
Our program adheres to the equitable use principle by providing equal means of use for all users. Our program does not segregate or stigmatize any particular users for any reason. The design of our app is simple to use and easy on the eyes, making it appealing to a large number of users.

#### Flexibility in Use
Our app design makes it easy to use by both left-handed and right-handed individuals. The app does not require pinpoint precision when used, making it more forgiving for those who are unable to be very precise. The app also allows users to use it at their own pace. 

#### Simple and Intuitive Use
Our app is fairly simple to use, however in the future, we could implement a feature that explains the basic features of the app in case the user does not already know. The information displayed on the app is very consistent with its importance. Our app also provides some feedback with completed tasks, but more feedback could also be implemented in the future.

#### Perceptible Information
By using high contrasting colours (dark grey and yellow), essential information is legible to the user and sufficiently contrasted with its surroundings. Since we had built our app in Android Studio, it should be compatible with a variety of Android devices.

#### Tolerance for Error
The elements on screen are arranged in an easy to use and familiar way to try to minimize any hazards or errors. In the future, we could implement some fail safe features, like an undo button for example, so the user could reverse any errors they might potentially make.

#### Low Physical Effort
Our application requires virtually no effort to use. It can be fully used in any body position, and no real operating force is needed for its use.

#### Size and Space for Approach and Use
Our app accomidates users with a variety of hand and grip size, provided they are able to comfortably hold and grip their own phone. The components of the app are within comfortable reach, again provided they are able to comfortably hold and grip their own phone.

### Marketing
Our application's target audience would be fighters who are seeking sparring partners. Our app is intended for fighters of any type, and they are able to display their fighting style on their profile. This is done so that users can choose which type of fighters they wish to swipe right in an attempt to match with them. Fighters of any kind can benefit from the use of our app, as it allows them to easilly find sparring partners so they can hone their fighting skills. To effectively market out application to our target audience, we could advertise it in places with a high frequency of fighters, such as any sort of fighting dojo.

### Demographics
Our program is most likely to be used by fighters, as its sole purpose is to match fighters with potential sparring partners. Due to our app's purpose, it is quite unlikely that our app would be used by non-fighters, as it would not serve them much use. The only likely reason a non-fighter would use our application is if they are looking to start getting into fighting, and are seeking for a sparring partner to start fighting with. As a result of our program's demographic, it would be in our best interest to specifically market our application to fighters.
