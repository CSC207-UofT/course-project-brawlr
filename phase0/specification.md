# Project Specification
Brawlr is a **Tinder-like app**, which, instead of connecting potential romantic partners, **connects potential sparring partners**. We want to create an app for individuals interested in MMA fighting to find someone for a fight.

**A fighter using the app will be able to:**

 1. **Make an account**, in which they can set their height, pronouns, weight, reach, location, style, description, controversial opinions, and photos.
    
2.  Sift through a **location-based list of potential sparring partners** in your area, and “swipe left” if they’re not interested (thus removing the other fighter from their list), and “swipe right” if they are interested in sparring with the individual
    
3.  Once the user has swiped right, the other fighter is then **added to the user’s list of interested matches** (though this list is not viewable by the user)
    
4.  When there has been a **mutual match** on both ends between the user and another fighter, **a chat then opens** between both users
    
5.  Once both users have messaged with each other and agreed to become sparring partners, they will be able to **access a map of the closest MMA gyms** near the both of them and select one for their sparring location
    
6.  Users will be able to **delete their chat** with a match as well
    
See below these **UI wireframes** for a better idea of the user flow:
