# Scenario Walk-Through

After opening the app, a **login screen** will be presented to the **user**. The user will have to sign in to their **account**, by inputting their **username and password**. If this is the first time the user uses this app, they will then be brought to a new signup **account creation page**.

Next up, the new user will have to input their **personal information** (pictures, biography, personal stats like height and weight, etc.), and controversial opinions (as a fun tidbit and instigator!).

The user will then be brought to the **main page (“swiping” area)**, where they will be fed other users’ profiles one by one based on location (proximity to the current user). The user will have to **swipe right** (if they’re interested in sparring with this user) or **left** (if they’re not interested) on a profile. Once the user swipes right or left on another user, they will no longer be able to view the swiped person again.

If the other user also swipes right on you, it is a **match**, and **a new chat** between the two users will automatically open in the **chat tab**. This will allow the two users to **message** each other and set up a fight. Setting up the fight will happen through a feature in the chat that brings up **a map of the nearest MMA gym locations** to either user, and the users can then select a gym location to set up their sparring match.
